This repository contains all of the code for the UCSB math DRP website. This site is hosted with GitHub pages and can be found at www.ucsbdrp.org.

Anyone involved in an administrative capacity with the DRP should feel free to message me, I'm happy to grant edit access.

Enjoy the updated website experience!
