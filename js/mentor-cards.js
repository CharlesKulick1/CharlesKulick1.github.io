In fact, it was complex analysis which led me to complex geometry, a subject which I am currently learning about. Complex geometry studies geometric structures which are described by complex numbers, such as complex manifolds and complex algebraic varieties. It is a highly attractive branch of modern mathematics which interacts with various other fields (differential, algebraic, and arithmetic geometry; sting theory), and is a great example of unity in mathematics.",
